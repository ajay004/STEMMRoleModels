Why we should develop using the Yeoman toolkit.

Yeoman is a robust set of tools, libraries and provide a workflow that can help developers quickly build beautiful, compelling web apps. It provides scaffolding, setting up new applications and sites based on skeletons called "generators". One of the best features of Yeoman is the ability to use custom generators.


Rules to live by
---
Yeoman provides an "opinionated" framework and a proscribed workflow for developers to conform to. In a distributed group this is one key to ensuring code quality.

Works well with common development workflow tools
---
- Grunt : task runner, useful for compiling css from less or sass files, concatenating and minifying JS files, and running unit tests, and linting when building the app. Can also use it to provide a simple web server for local development.
- Bower or NPM : package manager, allows you to include libraries like jQuery without having to download and maintain them in the project locally. Can configure the package manager to include a specific version or keep up to date with the latest.
