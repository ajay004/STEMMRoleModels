# Twitter guidelines

At the moment the [@STEMMRoleModels](https://twitter.com/STEMMRoleModels) twitter account is currently run by [@KirstieJane](https://github.com/KirstieJane). She tries to tweet by these rules:

 * **Stay positive** - although one of the goals of the STEMM Role Models project is to discuss the importance of diversity in STEMM fields, we don't want to add too much negative fuel to the social media storm. So if there are stories focused on failures of inclusivity, then try to re-tweet from personal accounts rather than from the STEMMRoleModels account. But if there are stories focused on the importance of diversity or on different efforts to tackle the problem then re-tweet supportively!

 * **Follow freely** - there are lots of great initiatives out there and many more members of under-represented groups who might want to connect with us (and with whom we almost CERTAINLY want to connect).

 * **Ask questions** - if we have a new issue or we want feedback on something to do with the project, ask the twitter followers for their thoughts! Remember to include the link to where they can contribute their thoughts if appropriate.
