## Schematic Design

#### How will the STEMMRoleModels App _work_??
To get us started, this is a conceptual sketch of the app's functionality.  Its purpose is to initiate a collective brainstorm on how we will build the the content and interface. Visual appeal and graphics will come soon! 

This is a work in progress, it will be updated as we get feedback and ideas from YOU! So please provide comments big and small.

#### Open Questions

Here's where we need your help!

###### General
  * Should users be allowed and/or _required_ to have an account (1) to search the app? (2) to edit its content?
  * Should added content be approved by a moderator before going live, or will the community police and fact-check itself?
  
###### Search entry
  * _How will a search be entered?_ This schematic proposes breaking it into two steps: First, entering general characteristics of the individuals you are trying to find. This might include field of research, country or a key word. Then, adding the option to restrict your search by demographic characteristics such as identified gender. 
  * What characteristics and demographics should be included in search options?
  
###### Search results
  * Should this integrate options to change your search or sort results in different ways?
  * Should users be able to save results to a personal list?
  
###### Researcher profiles
  * What fields should be available in a profile? 
  
###### Other
  * What suggestions do you have? Let us know!
