SUBJECT: ***STEMM Role Models development sprint - [DATE] - all welcome***

Dear [appropriate title eg: Cambridge Neuroscientists],

In February of this year my team and I won the runners up prize in the Rosalind Franklin appathon, a national competition to find the best ideas to harness the power of mobile technology to support women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths and Medicine. We are focusing on the problem that women in STEMM are underrepresented as conference speakers and panelists, even after accounting for their lower representation in the field. Our proposal is to develop a platform for an interactive and searchable database of researchers, with an emphasis on promoting those typically under-represented in STEMM: women, people of colour/black minority ethnic, people with a disability, LGBTQ and parent or carer. We are dedicated to open-source development of this project, and welcome anyone of any level of experience (including our friends outside the ivory tower of academia) to join us in our adventure!

As research scientists ourselves, we know the confidence that young researchers build when they see people "just like them" in leadership roles, and we know that increasing diversity can inspire the most creative ideas across all fields of STEMM and at every step along the academic career trajectory. We envision a database that conference organisers could use to widen their reach when considering who to invite to speak or to sit on panels. Each researcher profile contains information about the researcher's skills, publications, previous speaking engagements etc, as well as testimonials sourced from members of the community.

You can join us at any time at our [GitHub repository](www.github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels). The [README file](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/blob/master/README.md) gives an overview of the project, the [CONTRIBUTING file](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) tells you how you can get involved, and the [CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) outlines our rules of engagement (in short, be excellent to each other).

We also have a sprint half day coming up. It will be held on **XXXXXXX** from **2pm to 9pm** in the following three modules. You do not need to attend all of the modules, we're happy to have you take part in whichever you're interested in and that fit best with your schedule. Food and drinks will be provided!

  * 2:00pm to 4:00pm - **Intro to GitHub and how to contribute to open source projects**. This session is ideal for people who aren't sure how to get started contributing to the project. Please bring your laptop, or be prepared to share with someone when you arrive. Kirstie will give an overview presentation of both the STEMM Role Models project and an introduction to git and GitHub.

  * 4:30pm to 6:30pm - **Brainstorming ideas and project planning**. This session will focus on pitching ideas for development of the database, website and app, and steps toward implementation. You do not need to be able to implement your proposals at this stage, but if you're already an expert or want to learn more, hopefully you'll stay on to work toward implementation in the final session! 

  * 7:00pm to 9:00pm - **Implementing the suggestions**. In the final two hours, we'll be joined by developers from industry who will help implement the technical ideas that have been proposed in the previous session. This is an ideal cumulation of the day and we're very excited to have some real deliverables to take home!


Food and drinks courtesy of our sponsors [WHOT WE DON'T HAVE YET] including vegetarian and gluten-free options (please let us know of any dietary requirements when you register).

Thank you for reading all this way, and we're looking forward to seeing you on XXXXX<-- DATE
